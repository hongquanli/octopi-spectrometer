for sharing design, software and firmware for octopi-spectrometer

The latest software code was developed with inspiration from https://github.com/jonatanalvelid/Tempesta-RedSTED

## Getting started
The microscope is controled by an Arduino Due and a computer running Ubuntu. The computer can be one of the Nvidia Jetson platforms (e.g. Jetson Nano, Jetson Xavier NX) or a regular laptop/workstation. Instructions for using the firmware and software can be found in the respective folders.
